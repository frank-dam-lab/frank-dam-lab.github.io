### Welcome to the Adaptive & Dynamic Memory Lab
Our research explores  the processes that prioritise memory encoding and retrieval — from salient experiences to spontaneous reactivations — and how these processes change across the lifespan. We are part of the Andrew Mayes Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience at The University of Manchester.

#### Research Interests

  - Adaptive Memory Formation: How do we prioritise what to remember? We investigate mechanisms by which salience, novelty, and neuromodulation influence memory encoding. Our work examines how these processes support the selection and stabilisation of important memories.
  - Memory reactivation: the spontaneous replay of past experiences — plays a critical role in memory consolidation and decision making. We examine when and why this occurs, and how it may support flexible cognition and insight.
  - Memory Across the Lifespan: How do some people (superagers) resist the typical age-related decline in memory? We examine the neural and cognitive underlying age-related memory changes, and resiliecnce to such changes.

#### Methods
We use a multimodal approach to investigate memory, including:
- Virtual Reality: To simulate naturalistic, immersive experiences for encoding and retrieval
- Functional & Structural MRI:</strong> To study memory networks and neural dynamics
- Intracranial EEG (iEEG): For high-resolution tracking of hippocampal processes
- Eye-tracking & Pupillometry: To index attention, arousal, and neuromodulation
- Computational Modelling: To test and formalise memory-related computations
